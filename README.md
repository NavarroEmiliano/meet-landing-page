### Instructions

## Generate CSS from Sass

This project uses Sass for styling. The `.scss` files are located in the `./sass` folder. Follow these steps to compile Sass into CSS:

1. Install the project dependencies if you havenâ€™t already:
   ```bash
   npm install

2. Compile the Sass files into CSS using the following command:
   ```bash
    npm run sass:build

Note: If you encounter an error indicating that sass is not available, you might need to install Sass globally. 
Run the following command to do so:

    npm install -g sass

Then, try running the command again.

3. During development, you can use the following command to watch for changes in .scss files and automatically recompile them:
    ```bash
    npm run sass:watch
